<h1>What is the /g/sicp community?</h1>

<p>One time, one of our current members felt pretty bored. He created a thread on 4chan's /g/ where he proposed to teach programming (in Python) to those with no programming experience. Around 20 people, some complete newbs, some already accomplished programmers, joined up - #/g/sicp @ Rizon was the result. Since then, the project grew.</p>
<p>We currently:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Have projects where all collaborate as a learning experience</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Bhottu, our IRC bot, was the result of one of such experiences. Lots of people learned intermediate Python as a result.</li>
        <li>We also work together on tutorials - Our first one was Python, then C++ appeared (still in need of collaborators). Much more are planned.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Have a friendly community for aspiring and expert programmers to exchange insights</li>
    <li>Occasionally post porn</li>
</ul>
