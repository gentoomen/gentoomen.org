<h2><a name="home1.0">About Us</a></h2>

<div id="aboutus">
<p>Some time during december 2010, one of our current members felt pretty bored. He created a 
thread on 4chan's /g/ where
he proposed to teach programming (in Python) to those with no 
programming experience. Around 20 people, some complete beginners, some 
already accomplished programmers, joined up - #/g/sicp @ Rizon was the 
result. Since then, the has project grown. We also have another IRC channel that's used exclusively for discussing gentoomen matters.</p>

</div>

<div id="projects">

<h2><a name="home2.0">Projects</a></h2>

<p>Since everything we do is project based, you can participate in any area or subject you are
interested in and think you have something to contribute to.  </p>

<p>We are open to all ideas, so feel free  to suggest an idea and the channel may offer to assist you with it.
Want to learn a language? You could suggest a project using it.</p>

<h4>Currently We:</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Collaborate on projects as a learning experience.</dt>
      <dd>Bhottu, our IRC bot, was the result of one of these projects. Lots of people learned intermediate Python as a result.</dd>

    <dt>Have a friendly community for aspiring and expert programmers to exchange insights.</dt>
</dl>

<div id="tuts">

<h2><a  name="home2.1">Tutorials</a></h2>

<p>You can find our tutorials here, but the interest for these was lost rather quickly, as there are many much better books and tutorials out there.</p>

<p>You can always polish up an existing tutorial or write a new one if you'd like, but it's not encouraged to do so. It's a fun thing to do if you are bored and have nothing to do, though.</p>

<p>These are the ones we have so far. If you want to submit an addition or a correction, ask in the IRC channel.</p>

<div id="git">

<h2><a  name="home2.2"> Git</a></h2>

<p>We use git as our main tool for collaboration. Git is a distributed revision control system,
which allows multiple persons to participate on a software project. It tracks changes in software
made by users and allows a lot of control in versions. Even updates and edits to this website is handled trough git.</p>
<p>We have a organization called gentoomen in github, which acts as an umbrella for different
projects. Join our IRC channel to ask for access.</p>
<p>If you would like to help the community by writing a short tutorial on how to use git join our IRC channel.</p>
