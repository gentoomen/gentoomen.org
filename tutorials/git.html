		<ul><h2 id="0.0">0.0 Preface</h2>
			<ul>As the use of Git become ever more popular, it is important that
			potential contributors are given the tools they need to effectively
			interact with other developers.
			</ul>

			<ul>Git is one of the new(er) version control systems that was written by
			Linus Torvalds after some of his own personal frustration drove him to 
			create his own versioning system due to the inherent lack of speed and 
			simplicity provided by many of the more popular systems available. Linus 
			stated that his influences for Git were drawn from Mercurial
			</ul><br>

			<ul>Git is fairly easy to use, and is very quick in my experience. In this 
			tutorial we will cover many of the more popular uses for Git in order to
			allow complete beginners to the software development world a healthy 
			introduction to basic usage, maintenance, as well as etiquette.
			</ul><br>

		<h2 id="1.0">1.0 Installing Git</h2>

			<ul>The first step in using Git is obvious, we need to install it! This 
			will vary based on which Operating System you are using, but the 
			concept is the same:
			</ul>
			
			<h3 id="1.1">1.1 GNU/Linux</h3>
				
				<ul>Use your favorite package manager to download and install git, 
				it should already be in the repositories! (Note, if you need 
				assistance, please refer to your distribution's manual pages on 
				how to search/install packages).
				</ul>
				<ul>For more assistance, please visit 
				https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux
				</ul>

			<h3 id="1.2">1.2 Windows</h3>
				
				<ul>Download the .exe via http://git-scm.com/download/win
				</ul>

			<h3 id="1.3">1.3 Mac</h3>

				<ul>Download the .dmg via http://git-scm.com/downloads/mac
				</ul><br>



		<h2 id="2.0">2.0 Setting Git Up</h2>

			Once we have Git installed, we now need to configure our settings via
			Terminal.

			<h3 id="2.1">2.1 Username</h3>	

				<ul>In order for Git to properly label your commits, it is best to declare a global username.</ul><br>
				<ul>> git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"</ul>

			<h3 id="2.2">2.2 Email</h3>

				<ul>If you wish to get feedback based on your commits and be able to communicate with other developers, it is very handly to have a global email set that will be attached to your commits.</ul><br>
				<ul>> git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"</ul>

			<h3 id="2.3">2.3 - Password Caching</h3>
			
			<h3 id="2.4">2.4 - (Optional) Creating a Git Folder</h3>
			<ul></ul>
			<ul></ul>

			Terminal.
